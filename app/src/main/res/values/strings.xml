    <!-- Understanding First Time -->
    <string name="understanding_first_1_header">Which subscription plan is right for me?</string>
    <string name="understanding_first_1_text"> We offer three subscription plans. Each plan allows
        you to promote an unlimited amount of jobs and be matched to an unlimited
        amount of workers. But the amount of workers you can book is limited by the
        Subscription Plan you are on. Every time you book a worker, you use one of
        your Booking Credits.
\n\nHow many people do you hire per month?
\n\n1-4 hires - we recommend the BASIC Package (20 Booking Credits per user, per month)
        \n<font size="14">£499 +VAT (normally £999 +VAT) £24.95+VAT per Credit</font>
\n\n5-10 hires - we recommend the STANDARD Package (50 Booking Credits per user, per month)
        \n<font size="14">£999 +VAT (normally £1999 +VAT) - £19.98+VAT per Credit</font>
\n\n11-20 hires - we recommend the PREMIUM Package (100 Booking Credits, per user, per month)
        \n<font size="14">£1799 +VAT (normally £3599 +VAT) £17.99+VAT per Credit</font>
\n\n20+ hires - have your colleagues subscribe to one of the above or get in touch to
        discuss a bespoke subscription package.
\n\nWe make these recommendations so that you will have enough Booking Credits
        to connect with a shortlist of workers, before you hire the right
        workers for your business.
\n\nIf you are going to have a particularly busy month, you are able to
        top up your Booking Credits, 10 at a time for £299+VAT (normally £599+VAT).
        Top Up Booking Credits are valid for one month from date of purchase.
        Top Up Booking Credits can only be used in conjunction
        with an existing subscription plan.
\n\n\n<font size="14">Booking Credits are non refundable, non exchangeable
        and time bound. Booking Credits cannot be carried over from one month to another.
        Once you have used a Booking Credit, it cannot be refunded or exchanged even
        if the worker cancels or you decide to cancel a worker or a job.</font></string>
    <string name="understanding_first_2_header">What\'s a booking?</string>
    <string name="understanding_first_2_text">Each time you book a worker, you use a Booking Credit.
\n\nThe Square allows you to promote an unlimited amount of jobs and be matched to
        an unlimited amount of workers. But the amount of workers you can book is
        limited by the Subscription Plan you are on. Every time you book a worker,
        you use one of your Booking Credits.
\n\nThere are two ways you can book a worker:
\n1. By offering a worker a job and they accept the offer
\n2. The worker applies to your job and you accept their application.
\nEither of these transactions counts as booking a worker and uses a Booking Credit.
\n\nA booked worker gives you extra details which includes contact details.
        The booked worker is also given your contact details and information about
        where and when to turn up for the job.
\n\nEvery booked worker uses a Booking Credit, even if you, or the worker, later
        cancels the booking. If you are satisfied with the worker you have booked
        and do not wish to book any more workers for a particular job, we suggest
        you cancel any outstanding job offers to avoid wasting Booking Credits.
\n\n<font size="14">Booking Credits are non refundable, non exchangeable and

</string>
    <string name="understanding_first_3_header">How am I billed?</string>
    <string name="understanding_first_3_text">You are billed one month in advance to
        cover your subscription for that month. The Square will charge you on
        a monthly basis on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement
        of your initial subscription. Our subscription plans are recurring payments.
        Your subscription will automatically renew using the credit card
        you have provided. You can cancel automatic renewal of your subscription
        at any time by clicking \'Cancel My Subscription\' in My Price Plan
        and you will be able to use any remaining Booking Credits until the
        expiry date of your subscription.
        \n\nIn some cases your payment date may change, for example if your
        credit card has not successfully settled, if your paid membership
        began on a day not contained in a given month, or if you
        upgrade your account causing your renewal date to change.</string>
    <string name="understanding_first_4_header">How do I activate my free trial?</string>
    <string name="understanding_first_4_text">Your free trial will be activated as soon as

    <string name="understanding_first_5_header">Will I be charged during my free trial?</string>
    <string name="understanding_first_5_text">You won\'t be charged during your free trial,

        be automatically charged in advance for the next month of your subscription.
        \n\nYou can cancel anytime during your free trial and before your

    <string name="understanding_first_6_header">What happens after my free trial period?</string>
    <string name="understanding_first_6_text">If you do not cancel before your

            \n\n4. You will be asked if your are sure you want to cancel
            \n\n5. Selecting you want to cancel will mean your subscription
        will end at midnight before the scheduled renewal date
            \n\nOnce you have cancelled, you will still be able to use any
        remaining Booking Credits until your subscription end date.
            \n\n<font size="14">To the extent permitted by the applicable law,
